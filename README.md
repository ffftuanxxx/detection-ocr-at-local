# Object Detection and OCR Tool

This project provides a detection and OCR (Optical Character Recognition) tool that can run on both local computers and phones directly using small models.

## Features

- Object detection
- OCR capabilities
- Cross-platform support (computer and Android phones)
- Lightweight models for efficient local execution

## Files

- `object-detection-webapp.html`: Main web application for object detection
- `object-detection-webapp (1).html`, `(2).html`, `(3).html`: Additional object detection web app variations
- `phone_detection.html`: Specific file for phone-based detection

## Usage

### On Computer

Run any of the `object-detection-webapp.html` files in a web browser.

### On Android Phone

1. Open your phone's web browser
2. Load the `phone_detection.html` file
3. Grant necessary camera permissions when prompted

**Note**: It's crucial to run `phone_detection.html` on the local phone device's **default** web browser. Otherwise, the program may not be able to access the camera.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the desired HTML file in a web browser
3. Follow on-screen instructions for object detection or OCR
